// This file is automatically compiled by Webpack, along with any other files
// present in this directory. You're encouraged to place your actual application logic in
// a relevant structure within app/javascript and only use these pack files to reference
// that code so it'll be compiled.

// NOTE: This pack is NOT meant for actual use.
// Its purpose is to get webpacker to find these files so they can be loaded
// via the `asset_pack_path` method.
